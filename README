Instructions on running Code: 
- run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- run the command "python3 assessment.py"
- You will be prompted to enter the file names that you want to annotate WITHOUT THE EXTENSION
  - For example: com.apalon.ringtones com.dropbox.android com.giphy.messenger-1 
- Hit enter and check the annotated_images folder

I used the following Repositories: 
- lxml to parse the xml (pip install lxml) 
- pillows for annotating the images (pip install pillows) 
- json to convert the bounds from a string to a usable list
- os to create a new folder to put the annotated images in 

Description
My implementation involves a command line input from the user with the format <app.package>-<screen#>. The user can put multiple inputs if needed.
Using this format, my implementation will attempt to open a matching xml and png file. If this file pair is not present, the next user input is checked. 
The user can add additional png/xml pairs to the Programming-Assignment-Data folder as long as these criteria are met. 
If both necessary xml and png files are present and the xml/png files are valid, we will iterate all of the leaf nodes (child nodes with no children) and get the bounds attribute. 
Using the bounds attribute, we can use the Pillow library to draw a square on the provided png. After all of the leaf nodes are iterated/drawn, the image is added to the annotated_images folder, 
and the next image is annotated.
